      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p class="medium justify">This Privacy Policy describes how your Personal Information is collected, used, and
        shared by
        Brainbot Labs Est. (“BBLE”).
        Personal Information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, who may be
        identified, directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number,
        location data, online information (e.g. an IP address) or to one or more factors relating to that person.
        This notice applies to Personal Information provided to us by visitors to
        <a href="https://www.brainbot.li/" target="_blank">https://www.brainbot.li/</a> and/or
        <a href="https://raiden.network/" target="_blank">https://raiden.network/</a> (the “Site”), end users,
        beta testers, suppliers, contractors, job applicants, customers or other direct or indirect users or recipients
        of the services we carry out and functions we perform in running the Site. In this notice “you” refers to any
        individual whose Personal Information we hold or process.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>1. BASIS ON WHICH WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">Personal Information we hold about you will be processed either because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”; a legitimate interest in this context
          means a valid interest we have or a third party has in processing your personal data which is not overridden
          by your interests in data privacy and security;
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes described in this notice; or
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          the processing is necessary in order for us to comply with our obligations under a contract between you and
          us.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about you and your device,
        including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed
        on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
        products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
        interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
        We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
          identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="justify">“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
          browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
          Site.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="medium justify">
        Additionally, when you sign up for a newsletter through the Site, we collect your email address
        and may collect additional contact details such as your address and phone number. We refer to this information
        as “Subscription Information.”
        In the course of our interactions, we may also collect a record and details of any correspondence or
        communications between you and us or relating to any job application, information request or job application
        submitted to us. We refer to this information as “Communication Information”.
        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information,
        Subscription Information and Communication Information.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>3. HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">We use or may use the Subscription Information and Communication Information that we
        collect
        generally to communicate with you via the newsletters you have subscribed to and to provide any other
        information you have requested or respond to any other correspondence. (This processing is necessary for our
        legitimate interests in being part of the Raiden Network ecosystem and is carried out on the basis that you have
        consented to us communicating with you in such manner.)
        We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
        your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics
        about how you browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our communication campaigns).
        (This processing for our legitimate interests in managing the information we provide via our Site and to assess
        how people use the Site.)
        We also use your Personal Information to further develop the Site, administrate our Site and comply with all
        legal requirements.</p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>4. SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information,
        as described above. We use Google Analytics to help us understand how you use the Site–you can read more about
        how Google uses your Personal Information here:
        <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"
           target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also opt-out of Google
        Analytics here:
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
        We may disclose your Personal Information to other third-party suppliers that enable us to provide the Site and
        any connected services including technical support providers who may have access to personal data. These may
        include software and website developers, IT support and mail management service providers. In all cases, our
        agreement with the relevant third party will contain appropriate provisions regarding the use and security of
        your Personal Information.
        Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond
        to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our
        rights.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>5. DO NOT TRACK</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do
        Not Track signal from your browser.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>6. TRANSFERRING YOUR INFORMATION OUTSIDE EUROPE</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will not transfer any data in a systematic way outside of the EEA but there may be
        circumstances in which certain personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, in particular:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          if you live outside of the EEA, we may communicate with you during the course of our interactions and such
          communications may include Personal Information (such as Subscription Information);
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          we may have certain third-party service suppliers who are based outside the EEA or who store data outside of
          the EEA;
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          if you communicate with us while you are outside of the EEA there may be some data transfer to you or your
          device;
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          from time to time your information may be stored in devices which are used by staff engaged by BBLE when
          outside of the EEA.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="medium justify">
        If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in a systematic way, and the third country or
        international organisation in question has not been deemed by the EU Commission to have adequate data protection
        laws, we will provide appropriate safeguards and your privacy rights will continue to be enforceable against us
        as outlined in this notice.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>7. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        In accordance with the GDPR and data protection laws applicable to you, the following rights may be available to
        you: The right (1) to be informed about our data processing activities (2) of access to the Personal Information
        we hold about you (3) to correction of your Personal Information if it is incomplete or inaccurate (4) to
        deletion of your Personal Information or (5) to restriction or limitation of the processing of your Personal
        Information and (6) to object to the processing of your Personal Information and (7) to receive copies of your
        Personal Information in a commonly used form and to transfer it directly to a third party.
        If we are relying on your consent as the basis on which we are processing your Personal Information, you have
        the right at any time to withdraw your consent at any time.
        Any request made under (2) above (a subject access request) or any other notification in respect of your rights
        must be sent to us by email to: contact[at]brainbot.li or by post to: Brainbot Labs Est., Industriering 40, 9491
        Ruggell, Liechtenstein.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>8. DATA RETENTION</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        When you sign up for a newsletter through the Site or we acquire your Personal Information due to another
        interaction with BBLE, we will generally maintain your Personal Information for our records for twelve months
        unless you ask us to delete this information before such time has passed.
        We may retain your Personal Information for more than twelve months if we consider it is necessary to enable us
        to satisfactorily provide the information on the Site or administer the Site or to enable us to comply with any
        statutory, legal or contractual obligation we may have.
        We review the Personal Information (and the categories of personal data) we are holding on a regular basis to
        ensure the data we are holding is still accurate and is still relevant to BBLE and its Site. If we discover that
        certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or
        delete this data as may be required.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>9. SECURITY</h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are carried
        out in order to safeguard your Personal Information and protect against unlawful access and accidental loss or
        damage. These measures may include (as necessary):
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>compliance with our internal IT security procedures;</li>
        <li>protecting our servers by both hardware and software firewalls;</li>
        <li>locating our data processing storage facilities in secure locations;</li>
        <li>using appropriate support tool and mailing list management providers;</li>
        <li>when necessary, disposing of or deleting your data in a secure manner; and</li>
        <li>regularly backing up and encrypting all data we hold.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will ensure that all contractors, staff or individuals engaged by us are aware of their privacy and data
        security obligations. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the employees of third parties working on our
        behalf or providing services to us are aware of their privacy and data security obligations.
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted by you to us
        by email. Once we have received your information, we will use the procedures and security features referred to
        in this Privacy Policy to try to prevent unauthorised access.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="first-line-span">.</span>10. CHANGES</h2>

        We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices
        or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
